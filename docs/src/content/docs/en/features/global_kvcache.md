# Global Multi-Level KV Cache
## Background

Long-context inference repeatedly reads historical KV cache during autoregressive decoding. As model sizes and context windows grow, device memory capacity and bandwidth become major constraints. A device-only cache also makes a cold request recompute a prefix even when the same prefix was produced by an earlier request or another xLLM instance.

xLLM extends the device prefix cache into a three-level hierarchy:

| Tier | Purpose | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Device HBM | Lowest-latency KV used by the current forward pass | Device-local |
| Host cache | Pinned CPU-memory staging and reusable host prefix cache | xLLM process |
| Mooncake Store | Distributed KV objects shared across xLLM processes and restarts | Store cluster |

A request first checks the Host prefix cache. Missing full blocks can be fetched from Mooncake Store into preallocated Host blocks, restored to HBM layer by layer, and reused without recomputing the matched prefix. Completed HBM blocks are asynchronously copied back to Host memory and then written to Mooncake Store.

The current implementation uses `HierarchyBlockManagerPool` to manage block allocation, mounting, and lifetime; `HierarchyKVCacheTransfer` to perform unified Host-to-Device and Device-to-Host transfers; and one `KVCacheStore` in each worker to access Mooncake Store. A single Store client can manage the target model, a speculative draft model, and multiple `BlockType` values from the same model.

## Architecture

The deployment can contain the following components:

- **etcd**: Registers compute instances and synchronizes service metadata.
- **xLLM Service**: Routes requests and manages fused or disaggregated Prefill/Decode instances.
- **HierarchyBlockManagerPool**: Probes the device and Host prefix caches, creates G2H, H2D, and D2H2G plans, and publishes or releases blocks after asynchronous work completes.
- **HierarchyKVCacheTransfer**: Registers target and draft cache domains, creates Host caches, and performs Host-to-Device and Device-to-Host copies.
- **KVCacheStore**: Maps each logical block to one or more Mooncake objects and performs batched reads, writes, and logical-hit aggregation.
- **xLLM Worker**: Owns the device and Host KV caches, `HierarchyKVCacheTransfer`, and `KVCacheStore`, and executes inference.
- **Mooncake Store**: Provides the distributed, process-independent KV object tier.

The service-level architecture is shown below:

## Cache Layouts and BlockType

`HierarchyBlockManagerPool` uses `CompositeBlockManager` to combine a request's cache pools. The hierarchy currently supports three layouts:

| Layout | Device/Host `BlockType` | Complete copy unit / write-back boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `FLAT_KV` | `KV` | One complete KV block |
| `FLAT_KV_LINEAR` | `KV`, `LINEAR` | For Qwen3.5/GLM5.3, one checkpoint/copy unit every `max_tokens_per_chunk_for_prefill` completed tokens |
| `SWA_COMPRESSED` | `SWA`, `C4`, `C128` | For DeepSeek-V4, each unit is exactly `1 SWA + 32 C4 + 1 C128`, or 34 transfer entries |

`KV` is the attention cache used by ordinary and Qwen-family models. `SWA`, `C4`, and `C128` are independent pools in the DeepSeek-V4 compressed-cache layout. `C4` and `C128` must be complete, while `SWA` only needs to cover the window immediately before each restorable `C128` checkpoint. On Decode, the `SWA` Host leaf is write-back-only and does not participate in prefix probing or Host restoration.

With linear attention (GDN/KDA), KV and recurrent state use separate Host block pools, each scaled by `host_blocks_factor`. Host transfer for `LINEAR` stores only committed state: it copies only the first three rows of the device Conv history and the first checkpoint row of the current SSM slot. Prefill retains at most two rolling slots, `[restore, live]`. `EMBEDDING` is a per-sequence speculative-decoding embedding slot; it is not part of hierarchical KV transfer and does not create Mooncake Store objects.

`HierarchyKVCacheTransfer` currently supports H2D and D2H2G copies for `LINEAR`, but the Mooncake G2H prefetch unit in `HierarchyBlockManagerPool` is fully implemented only for `FLAT_KV` and `SWA_COMPRESSED`. Consequently, `FLAT_KV_LINEAR` can use Host transfer and eligible checkpoint write-back, but should not rely on the current Store path for cross-process prefix prefetch. Full Store admission and rolling-state lifetime management for `LINEAR` remain incomplete.

## Unified Cache Domains and Store Keys

`HierarchyKVCacheTransfer` supports multiple registered cache domains. Normal inference registers only the target-model domain. Speculative decoding registers the target and draft models with the same transfer instance so they share one Host-transfer layout and one `KVCacheStore`:

| Cache domain | `CacheRole` | Store `key_component` |
|---|---|---|
| Target model | `TARGET` | Fixed to `main` |
| Embedded draft | `DRAFT` | `spec_draft::<algorithm>::embedded` |
| Separate draft model | `DRAFT` | `spec_draft::<algorithm>::<directory-name>::<normalized-path-digest>` |

During initialization, the Store builds an index by `BlockType`. Every cache domain that supports that `BlockType` produces a separate physical object. For example, when both the target and draft models contain `BlockType::KV`, one logical KV block maps to two Store objects. If a `BlockType` exists only in the target model, only the target object is generated.

The current object-key namespace is `xllm-kv-v3`. `model_id` and `key_component` use length-prefixed encoding, while hash fields are appended as 128-bit binary values. Conceptually, a key contains the following fields:

```text
Non-MLA: xllm-kv-v3:<model_id>:<key_component>:<tp_size>:<tp_rank>
                      :<kv_split_size>:<kv_split_rank>:<block_type>
                      :<schema_hash><block_hash>

MLA:     xllm-kv-v3:<model_id>:<key_component>:mla
                      :<kv_split_size>:<kv_split_rank>:<block_type>
                      :<schema_hash><block_hash>
```

- `model_id` is the target-model namespace and is included in both target and draft objects.
- `key_component` separates the target model, speculative algorithm, and draft-model source.
- Non-MLA caches use `tp_size`, `tp_rank`, `kv_split_size`, `kv_split_rank`, and `block_type` to isolate different parallel topologies, ranks, KV shards, and cache types. Here, `tp_size` and `tp_rank` are the effective local TP topology used by the Store client and do not necessarily equal the global process rank.
- MLA KV cache uses a fixed `mla` marker and omits `tp_size` and `tp_rank`; `kv_split_size` and `kv_split_rank` remain part of the object key. With `kv_split_size=1`, KV is not sharded, every rank reads the same object, and only TP rank 0 writes it. With KV split enabled, each KV split rank reads and writes its own Store object.
- `kv_split_size` is the effective number of KV shards, and `kv_split_rank` is the current Worker's shard index. A configured value of `0` inherits `cp_size`; `1` disables KV sharding and fixes `kv_split_rank` to `0`.
- `schema_hash` is derived from the parallel mode, `BlockType`, and each tensor's role, dtype, and per-block shape, excluding the number of Host blocks. Changing only `host_blocks_factor` therefore does not change object keys. Changes to the KV/LINEAR/compressed layout, dtype, role, or per-block shape automatically select a new key space.
- `block_hash` is the 128-bit content hash of the corresponding logical block. For `LINEAR`, it identifies the committed recurrent checkpoint state.

The Store API exposes logical blocks to its caller and expands them into physical cache-domain requests internally. A worker reports a hit only when **all physical objects** for that logical block are read successfully. `PrefetchResult` then applies a logical AND across the local Worker group involved for the current DP rank. The group size is `world_size / dp_size`; which TP/CP workers it contains depends on the backend topology and must not be reduced to TP rank alone. With KV split enabled, different `kv_split_rank` values use different object keys and cannot be treated as the same cache copy. A Store hit is publishable only when every cache domain and every required Worker are complete.

### KV Split and Store

KV split can be enabled together with Mooncake Store. The Store maps every logical block to an independent object key for each `kv_split_size` and `kv_split_rank`, so one KV shard cannot overwrite another or be mistaken for a complete KV hit. During Store restoration on Prefill, a block is mounted into the Host Prefix Cache only when every registered cache domain and every Worker required by the request hit.

For MLA cache, the unsharded configuration still lets only TP rank 0 write the shared object; with sharding enabled, every KV split rank writes its own object. Under speculative decoding, the target and draft models retain separate `key_component` values and each cache domain is further separated by KV split, so a missing draft shard makes the corresponding logical block a miss.

Valid `kv_split_size` values are checked against the backend, model, and parallel topology. In a conventional CP configuration, `K` must be positive and meet the backend constraint, usually by dividing `cp_size`; `0` inherits `cp_size`, and `1` disables KV sharding. Instances that need to reuse the same Store objects must use the same model identity, cache layout, and effective split topology. Different split topologies occupy different key spaces and do not cross-hit.

## Block Lifecycle

For `FLAT_KV` and `SWA_COMPRESSED`, fused instances and the Prefill side of disaggregated PD use the complete Mooncake admission, Host restore, and write-back path. Decode keeps Store enabled for its Host/Mooncake write-back path, while its request-admission path remains Device-prefix-only. `FLAT_KV_LINEAR` currently guarantees only Host-to-Device and Device-to-Host transfer plus eligible checkpoint write-back; the complete Store-admission path in the diagram does not apply to it. With speculative decoding enabled, each logical block operation in the diagram covers every target or draft cache domain that supports its `BlockType`.

Scheduling-side and execution-side responsibilities are separate:

- `HierarchyBlockManagerPool` owns `load_block_transfer_infos_` and `offload_block_pair_queues_`, block ownership, Host destination reservation, and publish/free operations in completion callbacks. It generates and records transfer plans but does not perform physical copies.
- In each Worker, `HierarchyKVCacheTransfer` performs the actual layer-wise Host-to-Device and Device-to-Host copies and Store get/put operations, creates copy streams, events, and `LayerSynchronizer`, and records `batch_id -> HostKVLoadHandle`. D2H results return to the scheduling side through futures, where the BlockManager aggregates them and updates the Host Prefix Cache.

Write-back does not wait until request `deallocate`. After each Forward updates the HBM token cursor, the next `allocate/grow` publishes the copy unit completed by the previous Forward and immediately collects a new D2H2G mapping. Ordinary models collect once per complete KV block; DeepSeek-V4 collects once per `1 SWA + 32 C4 + 1 C128` composite unit; Qwen3.5/GLM5.3 collect once per chunked-prefill stride. `deallocate` only collects the final complete unit that has not yet been queued, then releases the sequence.

Arrows in the following diagram use function names from the implementation. State changes, thread relationships, and data semantics are described in `Note` entries.

## Speculative-Decoding Cache

When speculative decoding and the Host cache are enabled, `SpeculativeWorkerImpl` makes the target and draft workers reuse one `HierarchyKVCacheTransfer`. Both cache domains must share the same producer stream. After registration is finalized, xLLM creates their Host caches, Host-transfer implementation, and `KVCacheStore` together.

The unified cache domains have the following behavior:

- G2H prefetch reads both target and draft objects. If any object is missing, the logical block is treated as a miss so xLLM never restores an incomplete draft state.
- H2D and D2H requests create separate `target_mappings` and `draft_mappings`, but advance under the same `batch_id` and layer synchronizer.
- D2H2G write-back first copies both cache domains into their Host caches, then writes each domain through the same `KVCacheStore` into its own key space.
- Draft keys automatically include the speculative algorithm and draft source. Changing the draft path selects new keys. If weights are replaced in place at the same path, change `model_id` as well.

Normal non-speculative inference still registers only the `main` cache domain and retains the previous single-domain behavior.

## Disaggregated PD

In disaggregated PD, Mooncake Store admission and Host-to-HBM restore run on the **Prefill** instance. The Decode instance allocates destination Device blocks before Prefill starts and only probes its Device Prefix Cache during admission; it does not mount Host aliases, fetch a prefix from Mooncake, or schedule Host-to-Device restoration. Decode still enables Store and Host cache capacity for its write-back path.

The scheduler supports both `PUSH` and `PULL` through `kv_cache_transfer_mode`. The current code no longer provides a `kv_cache_transfer_type` option. Enable the global Mooncake Store tier on both Prefill and Decode, using disjoint `store_local_hostname` base-port ranges.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Build and install [xLLM](/en/getting_started/quick_start/).
- Install [xLLM Service](https://github.com/xLLM-AI/xllm-service) when service routing or disaggregated PD is required.
- Build or install the Mooncake Store `mooncake_master` and `mooncake_client` binaries.
- Reserve enough Host memory. `--host_blocks_factor > 1` is required to create Host Cache. Mooncake Store additionally requires `--enable_prefix_cache=true` together with `--host_blocks_factor > 1`.
- For DeepSeek-V4 compressed cache, Host capacity is allocated independently for `SWA`, `C4`, and `C128`. With linear attention, `KV` and `LINEAR` also consume separate Host block pools. Do not estimate Host memory from ordinary KV blocks alone.

Mooncake's etcd-backed high availability backends are enabled by default when building xLLM and the bundled Mooncake binaries:

```bash
MAX_JOBS=32 SKIP_EXPORT=1 \
  python setup.py build --device npu
cmake --build build/cmake.linux-aarch64-cpython-311 \
  --target mooncake_master mooncake_client -j32
```

Ready-to-use HA master, independent Store client, and xLLM argument scripts are available under `scripts/kvcache_store/`.

### Start a Minimal Mooncake Store

The following TCP example uses Mooncake's P2P handshake, so no separate Transfer Engine metadata service is required:

```bash
export MC_STORE_CLUSTER_ID=xllm-mooncake

mooncake_master \
  --rpc_address=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc_port=50051
```

Start at least one resource-owning Store client:

```bash
mooncake_client \
  --host=0.0.0.0:50053 \
  --port=50052 \
  --global_segment_size=4GB \
  --master_server_address=127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --metadata_server=P2PHANDSHAKE \
  --protocol=tcp
```

### Start a High-Availability Mooncake Store Cluster

First start an etcd cluster reachable by every Mooncake master. Then start one master instance on each master node. All instances use the same etcd endpoints and `cluster_id`, while `rpc_address` must identify the reachable address of that specific instance:

```bash
mooncake_master \
  --enable_ha=true \
  --ha_backend_type=etcd \
  --ha_backend_connstring="10.0.0.1:2379;10.0.0.2:2379;10.0.0.3:2379" \
  --cluster_id=xllm-mooncake \
  --rpc_address=10.0.1.11 \
  --rpc_port=50051
```

Store clients and xLLM use etcd to discover and follow the current leader instead of binding to one master address:

```bash
export MC_STORE_CLUSTER_ID=xllm-mooncake
MOONCAKE_HA_ENTRY='etcd://10.0.0.1:2379;10.0.0.2:2379;10.0.0.3:2379'

mooncake_client \
  --host=0.0.0.0:50053 \
  --port=50052 \
  --global_segment_size=4GB \
  --master_server_address="${MOONCAKE_HA_ENTRY}" \
  --metadata_server=P2PHANDSHAKE \
  --protocol=tcp

/path/to/xllm \
  --enable_prefix_cache=true \
  --host_blocks_factor=4 \
  --enable_kvcache_store=true \
  --store_protocol=tcp \
  --store_master_server_address="${MOONCAKE_HA_ENTRY}" \
  --store_metadata_server=P2PHANDSHAKE \
  --store_local_hostname=127.0.0.1:12345
```

The `etcd://` prefix in `store_master_server_address` selects the HA leader-discovery backend. Do not add `http://` to the endpoint list after that prefix. When using a custom `cluster_id`, every Mooncake master, Store client, and xLLM process must use the same `MC_STORE_CLUSTER_ID`.

### Start etcd and xLLM Service

This step is required for service routing and disaggregated PD, but not for a standalone fused xLLM process:

```bash
./etcd \
  --listen-peer-urls=http://0.0.0.0:10999 \
  --listen-client-urls=http://0.0.0.0:10998
```

```bash
./xllm_master_serving \
  --etcd_addr=127.0.0.1:10998 \
  --http_server_port=28888 \
  --rpc_server_port=28889 \
  --tokenizer_path=/path/to/tokenizer_config_dir/
```

### Fused xLLM Example

```bash
/path/to/xllm \
  --model=/path/to/model \
  --model_id=my-model-revision-v1 \
  --enable_prefix_cache=true \
  --host_blocks_factor=4 \
  --enable_kvcache_store=true \
  --store_protocol=tcp \
  --store_master_server_address=127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --store_metadata_server=P2PHANDSHAKE \
  --store_local_hostname=127.0.0.1:12345 \
  --prefetch_batch_size=8 \
  --prefetch_timeout=30000
```

`store_local_hostname` is a base Transfer Engine endpoint. When no port is configured, it defaults to `127.0.0.1:12345`. Each worker uses `base_port + worker_rank`, so the entire port range must be free and reachable. Prefill and Decode, or multiple xLLM instances on the same node, must use disjoint base-port ranges.

For RDMA, set `--store_protocol=rdma`. Use `--store_rdma_devices=mlx5_0,mlx5_1` to select HCAs for the Store client embedded in each xLLM Worker, or leave it empty for Mooncake auto-discovery. Initialization failures remain RDMA failures and never fall back to TCP. xLLM does not read `DEVICE_NAMES`; the standalone `mooncake_client` uses its own `--device_names` option.

Speculative decoding does not require a separate draft Store namespace. xLLM automatically generates a distinct `key_component` for the draft cache. If `--model_id` is omitted, xLLM uses the final component of the model path; production deployments should still provide a stable `--model_id` that identifies the model version.

### Disaggregated PD Example

Use the normal [Disaggregated PD](/en/features/disagg_pd/) flags and enable Store on both roles. Use different `store_local_hostname` base ports for Prefill and Decode:

```bash
/path/to/xllm \
  --enable_disagg_pd=true \
  --instance_role=PREFILL \
  --kv_cache_transfer_mode=PUSH \
  --enable_prefix_cache=true \
  --host_blocks_factor=4 \
  --enable_kvcache_store=true \
  --store_protocol=tcp \
  --store_master_server_address=127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --store_metadata_server=P2PHANDSHAKE \
  --store_local_hostname=127.0.0.1:12345
```

If the backend and model on Prefill support KV split, the same command can include a parallel configuration such as:

```text
--cp_size=4 \
--kv_split_size=2
```

Here, `2` shards KV across two split ranks, and every shard uses an independent Store key. Whether Decode enables KV split, and which topology it uses, depends on its own backend and model support. A different topology uses a different Store key space.

Enable Store on Decode with a different local endpoint range:

```bash
/path/to/xllm \
  --enable_disagg_pd=true \
  --instance_role=DECODE \
  --kv_cache_transfer_mode=PUSH \
  --enable_prefix_cache=true \
  --host_blocks_factor=4 \
  --enable_kvcache_store=true \
  --store_protocol=tcp \
  --store_master_server_address=127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --store_metadata_server=P2PHANDSHAKE \
  --store_local_hostname=127.0.0.1:13345
```

See the [CLI Reference](/en/cli_reference/) for all `KVCacheStoreConfig` parameters. `prefetch_batch_size` controls the batch size for contiguous Store units. After a Worker encounters the first miss in a batch, it stops requesting later batches; the final hit length is the common prefix across all Workers. `layers_wise_copy_batchs` controls how many layers each synchronization event covers when Host-to-Device or Device-to-Host copies are grouped by layer.

## Correctness and Operational Notes

- Store hits use two levels of completeness checks: each Worker must successfully read every registered cache domain for the `BlockType`, and the local Worker group for the current DP rank must then report a hit before the block is mounted into the Host Prefix Cache. With KV split enabled, each `kv_split_rank` shard must hit independently.
- `prefetch_timeout` stops issuing new prefetch batches after the timeout, but admission still waits for every in-flight Worker batch to finish. `0` waits indefinitely.
- H2D registration does not wait for the physical copy. Forward attaches a `LayerSynchronizer` using `batch_id` and waits at the corresponding layers. The Scheduler receives no H2D-complete callback.
- Host Prefix publication depends only on successful D2H completion from every participating Worker. Mooncake `BatchPut` is best-effort; a partial Store write failure is logged but does not invalidate an already successful Host copy.
- `BatchPut` first deduplicates object keys. Mooncake's "object already exists" result counts as success and does not overwrite the existing object. Duplicate objects in one batch are written only once. A logical block counts as a Store success only when every cache-domain object already exists or is written successfully.
- The current Store key version is `xllm-kv-v3`. Host-block capacity is excluded from `schema_hash`, while tensor role, dtype, per-block shape, TP topology, `kv_split_size`, `kv_split_rank`, `BlockType`, and cache-domain identity isolate the key space. Objects written under older key formats do not match the current format and must be written again.
- Weight contents are not automatically encoded in object keys. Use a new `model_id` whenever target or draft weights, quantization, or any other setting that can change KV values is updated, and rotate or clean the old Store namespace as needed.
- In PD, Prefill and Decode both enable Store. They must use disjoint `store_local_hostname` base-port ranges because both roles reuse worker ranks and each worker binds `base_port + worker_rank`.
- The `LINEAR` state in `FLAT_KV_LINEAR` currently supports committed-checkpoint copies between Host and Device and eligible D2H2G checkpoint write-back, but it is not part of the current Store G2H prefetch-unit path. Before relying on cross-process `LINEAR` reuse, verify that the deployed version implements complete admission and rolling-state lifetime management.
